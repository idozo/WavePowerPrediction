# WavePowerPrediction
Wave power prediction using learning methods

The purpose of this project is to predict the wave power given the time span for the prediction. 
This report documents wave power prediction in a specific location in the Mediterranean Sea using different learning methods.
The previous report used KNN regressor in order to predict the wave power.
That work focused on finding the best number of features for the KNN regressor in order to minimize the prediction error. 
The first part of this report presents different regressors that try to predict the wave power for various numbers of hours ahead (will be referred below as the ‘hours-ahead’ value) more accurately. 
The second part focuses on prediction with Neural Networks, starting with basic network and trying to improve it with different methods.
